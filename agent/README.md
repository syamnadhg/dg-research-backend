# research-facade — the Super Agent bridge

Lets a chat runtime (Hermes / OpenClaw) drive **Super Research** as a *headless
session of your account*. You sign in once with Google (`/sr-login`); the bridge
then enqueues research runs on your account's existing devices, and every run
shows up in the web app like a normal chat.

- **Research-only.** It can run / track / fetch research. It can **never**
  control devices (add / remove / pair / share) — that stays owner-only.
- **One agent per account** (owner or sharer).
- **No dedicated worker, no separate logins, no identity minting.** It uses the
  account's existing devices, on the app's normal Firestore plane.

Design source of truth: `../SuperAgentRecipe.md`.

## The "nothing breaks" contract

This package is a **separate process** and never touches the existing app:

- No import of, or write to, `research-automate` or `research-app`.
- Its own secret-store namespace (`super-agent`, `~/.super-agent`) — **never**
  the device daemon's `super-research` keystore. The account refresh token and
  the device refresh token are different Firebase users; isolating them means a
  refresh here can never disturb a paired device.
- Writes only what a normal account client may write under the **existing**
  Firestore rules: research docs under your own tree + device-queue `start`
  docs where you're a member. No rules change, no keystore change, no queue /
  claim / pipeline change.

## Install (editable)

```sh
pip install -e .[dev]
```

This exposes the `agent` command.

## Use it from chat (Hermes / OpenClaw)

Install the Super Research skill into your chat runtime, then drive everything
with slash commands:

```sh
agent connect            # auto-detects ~/.hermes or ~/.openclaw (or: agent connect hermes)
agent serve              # start the always-up host bridge
# then in chat:  /sr-login → approve on your phone → /sr-research <topic>
```

`agent connect` copies a small, dependency-free skill (a `SKILL.md` + a
`scripts/sr.py` client that calls the bridge over loopback) into the runtime's
skills dir. The skill exposes `/sr-login` `/sr-logout` `/sr-device` `/sr-research`
`/sr-status` `/sr-podcast` `/sr-skip` `/sr-cancel` `/superresearch` (welcome / help)
— research-only; it can never control devices. (The commands are `sr-` prefixed
so they don't collide with the runtime's own `/login`, `/status`, `/help`, …)

**Keep it always-up.** Install a logon autostart so the bridge returns after a
reboot (Windows Scheduled Task); the account session + device selection persist,
so a restart resumes without re-login:

```sh
agent autostart install     # (uninstall / status too)
agent stop                  # stop the running bridge
```

## P0 — connect + prove the plane

```sh
agent serve            # start the loopback bridge (127.0.0.1:9876)
agent login            # opens http://localhost:9876/login → sign in with Google
agent status           # → "Signed in as you@…"
agent doctor           # health + token-refresh + connectivity checks
agent verify           # reads your researches + lists reachable devices
agent verify --enqueue --device <id> --topic "Tesla 2025"   # starts a real run
```

`agent verify` (no `--enqueue`) is read-only. With `--enqueue` it creates a
research doc + a device-queue start doc — a real pipeline run that will appear
as an app chat.

## P1 — remote sign-in + operational logging

**Remote sign-in (no localhost needed).** Approve from your phone via the
Super Research web app — the bridge brokers an OAuth device-style flow and makes
only outbound calls (see `SuperAgentRecipe.md` §11a):

```sh
agent login --remote --runtime hermes
#  → Open  https://superresearch.io/connect-agent  and enter code:  AB-12
#  (sign in to Super Research on your phone, tap Approve)
#  ✓ Connected as you@…
```

The plain `agent login` (local Google page at `http://localhost:9876/login`)
stays as a host-local fallback for dev / no-phone.

**Logging.** `agent serve` writes a durable, rotating operational log to
`~/.super-agent/bridge.log` (request + run-lifecycle lines; never a token).
Add `-v` / `--verbose` (before or after the subcommand) for DEBUG.

**Pick a device.** List the devices your account can reach and choose which one
runs your research (the selection persists across restarts in
`~/.super-agent/prefs.json`):

```sh
agent device                 # list (→ marks the selected one; (owned)/(shared))
agent device use <deviceId>  # switch the target device
```

`agent research`/`/sr-research` resolves the device as: an explicit id → your
selection → the sole reachable device → an error asking you to pick one.

**Run, track, cancel.**

```sh
agent research "Tesla 2025 outlook"   # start a run → prints a run id immediately
agent runs                            # list recent runs (status + phase)
agent run [id]                        # one run's status + links (no id = latest)
agent watch [id]                      # stream per-phase links live until it finishes
agent skip <id> <phases…>             # skip phases (1/3/4/5 or brief/podcast/video/report)
agent cancel <id>                     # stop a run (queued → dropped; running → stopped)
```

`agent skip` tunes the run's config (Brief / Podcast → `skippedPhases`; Video →
`videoEnabled` off; Report → `emailEnabled` off); the device applies it when each
phase is reached.

`agent watch` polls and prints each new link (Brief → ChatGPT/Gemini/Claude →
NotebookLM/Audio → YouTube → Doc) as the device produces it, then stops at a
terminal status. The same signal feeds a runtime's streaming cron via
`GET /updates` (account-wide active runs + their current links) — a poller
dedups by `(runId, kind)`. (No `?since=` watermark: the backend doesn't bump
`updatedAt` on a per-phase link write, so the current link set is returned every
poll and deduped client-side.) Cancel writes a single `action:"cancel"` to the
run's device queue — dropped if queued, stopped if running.

> The web app's broker routes (`/api/agent/login/{start,approve,poll}` +
> `/connect-agent`) are built separately under review; this package is only the
> outbound client.
